# Cloud Migration Strategy

This repository contains the infrastructure as code, migration scripts, and documentation for the cloud migration project.

## Project Overview

This project implements the cloud migration strategy described in the [Cloud Migration Strategy](../confluence_samples/05_cloud_migration_strategy.html) document.

## Migration Strategy

The migration follows a phased approach:

### Phase 1: Assessment and Planning
- Inventory of existing applications and infrastructure
- Application dependency mapping
- Cloud readiness assessment
- Migration strategy selection (6R approach)
- TCO analysis and business case development

### Phase 2: Foundation Building
- Cloud landing zone setup
- Network architecture design
- Security controls implementation
- Identity and access management
- Monitoring and logging infrastructure
- CI/CD pipeline setup

### Phase 3: Migration Execution
- Pilot migrations
- Data migration
- Application migration waves
- Testing and validation
- Cutover planning and execution

### Phase 4: Optimization
- Performance tuning
- Cost optimization
- Automation enhancement
- Modernization opportunities

## Migration Patterns (6R Approach)

1. **Rehost** (Lift and Shift)
   - Move applications to the cloud without changes
   - Suitable for legacy applications with minimal cloud dependencies

2. **Replatform** (Lift, Tinker, and Shift)
   - Make targeted optimizations during migration
   - Example: Migrating from on-premises databases to managed database services

3. **Refactor/Re-architect**
   - Significantly modify applications to leverage cloud-native capabilities
   - Example: Breaking monoliths into microservices

4. **Repurchase** (Drop and Shop)
   - Replace existing applications with SaaS alternatives
   - Example: Moving from on-premises CRM to Salesforce

5. **Retire**
   - Decommission applications that are no longer needed
   - Reduce the migration scope and associated costs

6. **Retain** (Revisit)
   - Keep applications on-premises for now
   - Suitable for applications with compliance requirements or recent investments

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- AWS Account with appropriate permissions
- Terraform 1.0+
- AWS CLI 2.0+

   - Internal tools and utilities
   - Development and test environments
   - Timeline: Q1 2025

2. **Wave 2: Business support applications**
   - HR systems
   - Finance applications
   - Internal collaboration tools
   - Timeline: Q2 2025

3. **Wave 3: Customer-facing applications**
   - E-commerce platform
   - Customer portal
   - API services
   - Timeline: Q3 2025

4. **Wave 4: Core business systems**
   - ERP system
   - Data warehouse
   - Business intelligence platform
   - Timeline: Q4 2025

## Security and Compliance

- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Network segmentation and security groups
- IAM roles and policies with least privilege
